    <h2>Kathuri Srikanth</h2>
   <b> <p>Chairman</p></b>
    <p>"Welcome to the realm of academic excellence at Vagdevi Degree College, nestled in the picturesque Palnadu region of Narasaropet since its inception in 2013. Our institution stands as a beacon of quality education, catering not only to the educational needs of the rural populace but also to the aspirations of urban students seeking a nurturing academic environment.
At Vagdevi, our primary mission is to unlock the latent potential residing within each student, providing them with a conducive platform to articulate their creative energies and articulate their perspectives in a tranquil setting. Our commitment extends beyond mere academic pursuits; we strive to equip our students with the skills and confidence necessary to excel in the professional arena.
Year after year, our dedication to securing promising career opportunities for our students remains unwavering. Renowned multinational corporations frequent our campus, conducting rigorous recruitment drives, and our students have consistently secured coveted positions across diverse industries. We leave no stone unturned in fostering the holistic development of our students, instilling in them the values of discipline, humanity, and a thirst for knowledge.
A distinguishing feature of our institution is the emphasis placed on honing interpersonal skills through engagements with seasoned professionals. Our meticulously designed modules are tailored to ensure that our students are not just academically proficient but also industry-ready upon graduation. We recognize that the journey towards success is not solitary; hence, we actively engage with parents, keeping them abreast of their wards' progress through regular correspondence and dialogues.
At Vagdevi, we firmly believe that success is a culmination of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. As we prepare our students to navigate the complexities of the world, we instill in them the values of informed decision-making and responsible citizenship. Our aspiration is not just to shape individuals but to mold future leaders who will, in turn, shape the destiny of our society.
We believe that complete development of a student into a holistic person requires active participation of the parents too. Thus the institution is in constant touch with parents informing them about the performance of their wards through correspondence and dialogues. Hard work, dedication and perseverance are the most important traits in a person that lead to success. The future belongs to you; your need, therefore, is to prepare yourself for an active participation in the world. This participation demands that you become well informed and hence develop yourself like a pioneer and ultimately grow as responsible men and women.
“We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future”. Remember “The reward of every good action will be good only”."</p>
